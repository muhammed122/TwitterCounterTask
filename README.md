**Tweet Character Counter**  

Tweet Character Counter is an Android UI component designed to ensure tweets adhere to Twitter’s character limit. It provides real-time character count validation and integrates seamlessly with Twitter’s API, allowing users to post tweets directly from the app.  

This project features accurate character counting, considering Twitter’s specific rules, including URL handling and CJK character adjustments. It follows a modular design, making the UI component reusable and easily integrable into other projects. Additionally, it enables real-time tweet posting through the Twitter API while ensuring secure authentication using OAuth 1.0.  

The application is built using modern Android development practices, including the MVI (Model-View-Intent) architecture, Clean Architecture principles, and Dependency Injection with Dagger Hilt. Kotlin Coroutines and Flows handle asynchronous programming, while ViewBinding ensures efficient UI management. The project also includes unit tests to verify character counting logic and API integration.  

To get started, developers need to clone the repository, configure Twitter API credentials, and build the project using Android Studio. The project is licensed under MIT, making it open for modifications and contributions.
